# Installing

There are two methods to installing the Road Runner library. [Method #1](#method-1-downloading-the-quickstart), the simpler option, is to simply download [the quickstart repo](https://github.com/acmerobotics/road-runner-quickstart). The quickstart repo is an empty FTC season repo. It includes everything you'll need to get Road Runner up and running. However, this obviously does not work if you already have an existing codebase. [Method #2](#method-2-installing-rr-on-your-project) simply has you copy over everything from the quickstart repo into your existing team project.
