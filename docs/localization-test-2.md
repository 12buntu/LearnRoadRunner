1. Run the `LocalizationTest` opmode via the RC.
2. Navigate to `192.168.49.1:8080/dash` with a phone RC or `192.168.43.1:8080/dash` with a Control Hub.
3. Drive the bot around. You should see it being drawn on the map in Dashboard.
4. Ensure that the drawn bot matches the orientation of the actual bot.
5. If so, go ahead. If not, you will need to go back and fix a previous step.
